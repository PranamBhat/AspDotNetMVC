<h2>Welcome to the sample ASP.NET MVC Web Application</h2>

<p>
    <strong>
        This web site is designed as a basic interoduction to GenericServices Framework's CRUD commands
        by showing them working in an ASP.NET MVC web site.
    </strong>
</p>
<h2>UPDATE for 2015</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>
            GenericService is now available on Nuget - see <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/GenericServices/" target="_blank">GenericServices on NuGet</a>.
        </h4>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>
            A new, more complex example is now available at <a href="http://complex.samplemvcwebapp.net/">Complex.SampleMvcWebApp</a>.
        </h4>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="text-info">Where should I start?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>You dive right in by clicking one of the menu links at the top of this page. Try Sync database -> @Html.ActionLink("Posts", "Index", "Posts") as a start.</li>
    <li>Go to @Html.ActionLink("this page", "CodeView") for more detail on what code features are shown on this site.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="text-info">This site is about programming, not styling</h3>
<h4 class="text-muted">
    The site introduces the GenericServices Framework for back-end development.
</h4>
<p>
    As much as possible the site uses the standard MVC5 BootStrap style and templates, because the main emphasis is on the back-end code. <br />
    I have made the styling as basic as possible, which should make it easier for you to restyle it the way you want it.
</p>
<small>Of course I have tried to stop it looking ugly. You can decide whether I succeeded.</small>

<h3 class="text-info">The pages are examples, not solutions</h3>
<h4 class="text-muted">
    The site demos framework commands. The data is irrelevant.
</h4>
<p>
    The aim is to show how you can use the GenericServices commands to manipulate data. <br />
    I have used fictitious, but credible data classes to do this. Some of the data validation rules are a somewhat bizarre to make a point.
</p>
<small>I have tried to make the data interesting. Enjoy.</small>

<h3 class="text-info">The pages contain explanations</h3>
<h4 class="text-muted">
    As well as showing the framework in action it includes links to explanations of the code.
</h4>
<p>
    On most pages you will see a @Html.ActionLink("Explanation of the code", "CodeView") link. It is normally on the right hand side above the data.<br />
